# quantum-tunnelling-simulation
A quantum tunneling simulation across a double-well potential using a 4-qubit register in Qiskit. It models the evolution of a quantum wavefunction under a custom Hamiltonian and uses the Quantum Fourier Transform to analyze energy dynamics. Built by Cole McLaren and Dan Griffith. 

# Features
- 4-Qubit register quantum state simulation
- Custom Hailtonian representing a double-well potential: `V = a(x² - b²)²`
- Quantum Fourier Transform for anaylsis
- D-Gate and Q-Gate implementation for time evolution
- Inverse Fourier Transform to return to
