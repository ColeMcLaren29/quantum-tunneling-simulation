# quantum-tunnelling-simulation
A quantum tunneling simulation across a double-well potential using a 4-qubit register in Qiskit. It models the evolution of a quantum wavefunction under a custom Hamiltonian and uses the Quantum Fourier Transform to analyze energy dynamics in quantum dynamics. Built by Dan Griffith and I
